# Shared Module

Reusable components, directives, pipes, and utilities used across features.

## Structure

- **components/** - Reusable UI components
- **directives/** - Custom directives
- **pipes/** - Custom pipes
- **utils/** - Helper functions and utilities

## Guidelines

- All items should be reusable across multiple features
- Export via barrel exports (index.ts)
- No feature-specific logic
